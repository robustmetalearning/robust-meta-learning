# Robust Few-Shot Learning with Adversarially Queried Meta-Learners

This repository contains PyTorch code for adversarial querying with [ProtoNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175), [R2-D2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08136), [MetaOptNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03758.pdf), and [MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) models.  We also include a re-implementation of [ADML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03316).

ProtoNet, R2-D2, and MetaOptNet can be found in [DifferentiableSolverMethods](DifferentiableSolverMethods).  MAML and ADML can be found in [MAML-ADML](MAML-ADML)

## Prerequisites for differentiable solver methods:
